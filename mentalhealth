        these are what we like to call the Golden Rules:# Regular exercise can be a great help to get relief from mild depression 
        Healthy diet: Eating the right foods can enhance serotonin production in the brain and banish depressive symptoms. 
        Increasing the amount of proteins, healthy fats, zinc and potassium along with fruits while simultaneously cutting processed 
        foods and high sugar beverages will significantly improve your mental and physical health. MEDITATION:
        Meditation is a practice which involves trying to train you to be mindful and your thoughts.
        to stay in the present moment, because in the present moment there is true peace.
        it helps to make our mind peace and remove depression
        Cold Showers-: Taking Very cold showers or ice baths can cause spikes in the dopamine levels and serotonin levels that can last 
        longer than more than a few hours giving you more energy throughout the day. Journaling: 
        Journaling at the end of the day is a great way to track your progress and also winding down. Just as the case was with Meditation,
        Journalling also helps you be more mindful throughout the day.'''
